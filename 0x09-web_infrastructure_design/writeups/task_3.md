# Scalable Web Application Infrastructure Setup

An overview of a scalable web application infrastructure, designed to handle increased traffic, ensure high availability, and maintain robust security. The setup consists of various components, each serving a specific purpose to enhance the reliability and performance of our web application hosted at www.foobar.com.

## Components

Our infrastructure includes the following components:

### Network Components

1. **Router (8.8.8.8)**: This router serves as the gateway to the internet, routing incoming HTTPS connections to the network.

2. **Firewalls**:
   - **Front-End Firewall**: Positioned before the load balancers, this firewall ensures that only authorized traffic reaches our load balancers.
   - **Perimeter Firewalls**: Each load balancer has a dedicated perimeter firewall to provide an additional layer of security.

### Load Balancers

3. **HAProxy Load Balancers (Clustered)**: We have configured two HAProxy load balancers as a cluster. This setup ensures high availability, fault tolerance, and efficient distribution of incoming traffic to web servers.

### Web Servers

4. **Web Servers (Nginx)**: Three Nginx web servers handle incoming client requests. These web servers serve static content and manage user interactions.

5. **Monitoring Clients for Web Servers**: Each web server has a monitoring client responsible for collecting performance and usage data.

### Application Servers

6. **Application Servers**: Three dedicated application servers are responsible for executing the application's business logic. These servers are designed for scalability to accommodate increased processing demands.

7. **Monitoring Clients for Application Servers**: Each application server has a monitoring client responsible for collecting performance and usage data.

### Database

8. **Master Database (MySQL)**: The MySQL master database server stores and manages data for the application.

9. **Database Replicas**: Two database replicas enhance data redundancy, read scalability, and failover capabilities.

## Architecture Overview

The scalable web application infrastructure operates as follows:

--- a simplified representation of how traffic would flow through the provided infrastructure setup using sample IP addresses:

1. **Client Request**:
   - A client (e.g., a web browser) initiates an HTTPS request to access www.foobar.com. The client's IP address is, for instance, 203.0.113.1.

2. **Router (8.8.8.8)**:
   - The client's request is first directed to the router, which has a public IP address (8.8.8.8).
   - The router's role is to route incoming traffic to the internal network.

3. **Front-End Firewall**:
   - The front-end firewall, which is part of the network's perimeter, checks and filters the incoming request to ensure its security.
   - If the request is deemed secure and authorized, it's allowed to proceed.

4. **Load Balancers (HAProxy Clustered)**:
   - The request, now deemed safe, is forwarded to one of the HAProxy load balancers.
   - Let's say the request goes to HAProxy Load Balancer 1 with an IP address of 192.168.1.101.
   - HAProxy Load Balancer 1 distributes the request to one of the web servers.

5. **Web Servers (Nginx, 3 servers)**:
   - The request reaches one of the web servers. For example, Web Server 1 with IP 192.168.2.1.
   - Web Server 1 processes the request, which may include serving static content or forwarding it to an application server.

6. **Application Servers (3 servers)**:
   - If required, Web Server 1 forwards the request to an application server. Let's assume the request is handled by Application Server 2 with IP 192.168.3.2.
   - Application Server 2 executes the application's business logic and may interact with the database.

7. **Database Tier (MySQL)**:
   - If the application server needs to fetch or update data, it communicates with the MySQL database server.
   - For instance, the Master Database has an IP address of 192.168.4.1.

8. **Monitoring Clients**:
   - Throughout this process, monitoring clients on web servers and application servers collect performance and usage data for analysis and troubleshooting.


## Key Benefits

Our infrastructure offers several benefits:

- **High Availability**: Clustering of HAProxy load balancers and redundancy in key components ensure high availability and fault tolerance.

- **Scalability**: Both web servers and application servers can be independently scaled to accommodate increased traffic and processing requirements.

- **Resource Isolation**: Component separation simplifies maintenance, updates, and resource management for web servers, application servers, and databases.

- **Load Balancing Flexibility**: Load balancers distribute traffic efficiently, improving performance and optimizing resource utilization.

- **Enhanced Security**: Firewalls and security configurations provide robust protection against unauthorized access and threats.

- **Improved Fault Tolerance**: Failures in one component have limited impact on others, minimizing downtime and disruptions.
