**Issue Summary:**
- **Duration of the Outage:** The issue occurred on September 20th, 2023, at 10:00 AM UTC and lasted until 11:30 AM UTC, causing an hour and a half of downtime.
- **Impact:** The outage affected the Docker Desktop service, rendering it unusable for all users during the downtime.

**Timeline:**
- **Issue Detection:** The problem was detected at 10:00 AM UTC when users attempted to start the Docker Desktop service and encountered a blank screen that would crash immediately. This was reported by several users in the organization.
- **Actions Taken:** The incident response team initiated investigations immediately. They suspected a potential conflict between the recently installed Wi-Fi driver update and the Docker Desktop service. The system logs were checked for error messages, and a series of diagnostic tests were conducted to identify the root cause.
- **Misleading Investigation/Debugging Paths:** Initially, the incident response team considered various possibilities, such as issues with Docker configuration files and potential conflicts with recent system updates. However, these paths did not yield any concrete solutions.
- **Escalation:** Given the critical nature of the issue and its impact on the organization's daily operations, the incident was escalated to the senior system administrator and the networking specialist for further analysis.
- **Resolution:** After further analysis, it was determined that the root cause of the issue was the recently installed Wi-Fi driver update (version 22.250.2). This update appeared to interfere with the Docker Desktop service, causing it to crash. To resolve the problem, the incident response team rolled back the Wi-Fi driver to the previous version, 22.150.1. This simple rollback fixed the issue, and the Docker Desktop service was able to start normally.

**Root Cause and Resolution:**
- **Root Cause:** The issue stemmed from a conflict between the newly installed Wi-Fi driver update (version 22.250.2) and the Docker Desktop service. This conflict caused the service to display a blank screen and subsequently crash, rendering it unusable.
- **Resolution:** The incident was resolved by rolling back the Wi-Fi driver update to the previous version (22.150.1), eliminating the conflict. After the rollback, the Docker Desktop service functioned as expected, and users were able to access it without any issues.

**Corrective and Preventative Measures:**
1. **Testing and Validation:** Implement a rigorous testing and validation process for all driver updates before deploying them on critical systems. This ensures that potential conflicts are identified and resolved before they impact the organization.

2. **Monitoring and Alerting:** Set up monitoring and alerting systems to proactively detect and respond to issues like this in the future. This would enable quicker identification and resolution of conflicts or problems.

3. **Documentation and Rollback Procedures:** Ensure that comprehensive documentation and rollback procedures are in place for critical software and driver updates. This will facilitate quick response and recovery in case of similar incidents.

4. **Communication Protocol:** Establish a clear communication protocol for incident reporting and escalation. This ensures that issues are promptly addressed by the appropriate personnel, minimizing downtime.

5. **User Feedback Channel:** Create a dedicated channel for users to report issues and feedback related to software updates. This allows for quick identification of problems and user impact assessment.

In conclusion, the hour and a half of downtime on September 20th, 2023, was caused by a conflict between a Wi-Fi driver update and the Docker Desktop service. This incident highlighted the importance of thorough testing, effective monitoring, and well-documented rollback procedures in maintaining system reliability. The corrective and preventative measures outlined above will help mitigate the risk of similar incidents in the future.
